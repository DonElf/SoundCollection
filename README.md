# SoundCollection
A Unity C# script to make managing/playing audio clips from a group quick &amp; easy,

To use, first create a Sound Collection asset.

Then, select the audio clips and collection, and click "Add to sound collections".

Alternatively, clicking on the sound collection will allow you to edit the list of clips in the inspector.

Options are available to add audio clips recursively, or to add dupliactes (just in case you need that). Recursive searching caches folders for good validation optimisation.
